# TrafficSignRecognition
A traffic signs dataset consisting of 31,367 images spread over 43 classes was used for training the model
The model architecture contains Conv2D, MaxPool2D layers and Dropout layers for handling the overfitting
The trained model was able to predict the correct class of test images with an accuracy of 97.26%
Built a graphical user interface that helps to save a lot of time in testing using the Python's inbuilt library Tkinter
